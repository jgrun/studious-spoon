\opening{To whom it may concern,}

I am currently a senior at CU Boulder and will be graduating with a BS in electrical and comuputer engineering with a minor in computer science in May of 2018. I found a posting on CUs Handshake board and was immediately interested in the embedded software components of the posting as well as the focus on design methodology. As an entry level engineer, I know I have a lot to learn when it comes to functioning in a larger company, and am excited to learn. I really enjoy working with other people to solve problems, and find that when I become invested in a problem I don't stop working on it until it is completed. I think I would be a great fit at Emerson and would love to learn from you.

If you find me qualified, I would love to meet in person. I tend to be most responsive to email, so please email me at jacob.grunwald@colorado.edu. Alternatively, call me at (832) 585-4297. Thank you for your time and consideration and I hope to hear from you soon!

%\closing{Sincerely yours,}
Sincerely yours,

Jacob Grunwald
